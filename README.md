# Galaksija-Emulator
An emulator of the Z80-based Yugoslav computer

## Quick info
The emulator is quite early in it's development stage and IS missing a lot of features.

It's code is mostly based on [this](https://emulator.galaksija.org/). So don't yell at me when you realize I plagirized it.

# Building/Running
You'll need:
 * Any dumb rock that can run a modern enough OS
 * A C compiler
 * CMake
 * SDL2
 * Pkg-Config
 * Git
 * Original firmware - NOT INCLUDED (I need to sort out the legalise first)
 * A brain
 
```
git clone https://github.com/nikp123/Galaksija-Emulator

```
